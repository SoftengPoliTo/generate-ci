cargo-rust-binary's description

**Note that**: the created Github Actions workflow uses a static code analysis tool, called `weighted-code-coverage`, which produces an `html` report that is hosted on [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). However, to make it work, you need to set the select box to **GitHub Actions** in the **GitHub Pages** panel contained in **Settings**, as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow).
